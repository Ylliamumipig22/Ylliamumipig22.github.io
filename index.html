            <h3> My name is Ylliam Umipig, I am 17 years old and I'm a senior at James Campbell High School<br>
    Some of my hobbies include, painting shoes, working out, and watching movies. I love to run<br>
    and I have been running track for all 4 years of high school, and cross country up until my Junior year.<br>
    As for my plans after high school, I want to stay on the island for college and attend the University of Manoa.<br>
    I'd also want to pursue a career in the medical field, although I'm not sure what career specificly yet.<br>
    For now, I'm just trying to chill out and enjoy my last year of high school.</h3>
